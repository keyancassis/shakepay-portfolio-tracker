# shakepay-portfolio-tracker

DESCRIPTION:
This web application displays the networth and current positions 
of a crypto portfolio. The networth over time is displayed in a table.

INSTRUCTIONS:
In project main directory:
1) source venv/bin/activate
2) python src/app.py
3) visit http://localhost:5000
4) enjoy!

IMPROVEMENTS:
Given more time I would:
- Use a line chart rather than a table to display networth over time
- More stylish UI
- Implement unit tests
- Include more formal documentation
